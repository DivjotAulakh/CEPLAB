# Academic Integrity Policy

## Purpose

To maintain a high standard of **academic integrity** across the Seneca community and provide the foundation for research, teaching, learning and working practices.

## Scope

This policy applies to current students and employees.

## Key Definitions

> **Academic integrity**  
> Within an academic environment, “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: **honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.** From these values flow principles of behaviour that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action to ensure the credentials granted to students accurately reflect their demonstrated knowledge and abilities.

- **Cheating** – Obtaining or attempting to get, or aiding another person to obtain, credit for work or improvement in performance evaluation by dishonest or deceptive means. Examples include, but are not limited to, **self-plagiarism**, **impersonation**, **falsification**, taking individual credit for group work, unauthorized collaborations and aids and **undeclared AI use**.
- **Contract cheating** – When a student submits academic work created by a third party as if it were their own for academic credit.
- **Falsification/fabrication** – Misrepresenting another student’s academic work, withholding or forging personal documentation to gain an academic advantage.
- **Impersonation** – Taking a test or assessment on behalf of another individual.
- **Plagiarism** – Using another individual’s, group’s or organization’s work as is or modified and presenting it as one’s own without properly citing the source. This may also include **self-plagiarism**.
- **Unauthorized aid** – Using non-approved supports to complete coursework or assessments, including AI, the internet, smartphones, etc.
- **Undeclared AI use** – Using AI to generate part or all of an assessment without a disclosure statement outlining how and to what extent the AI was used.
- **Academic integrity violation** – An attempt to gain an unfair advantage in any formal assessment.

- Before final decisions are made and/or sanctions are applied, the student’s record should be consulted to determine if there were **aggravating** and/or **mitigating** factors.
- Should a suspected violation result from, or be combined with, a suspected violation of [Seneca’s Student Code of Conduct](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/student-code-of-conduct) and/or another non-academic-related Seneca policy, the matter will be investigated and adjudicated through the processes found in the Student Code of Conduct.
